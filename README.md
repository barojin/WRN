A admin can CRUD the any post in the website.   
A user can CRUD posts which (user_id in session == user_id in posts DB.). 
A guest can read posts only.   

The views are divided by the user's role registered in the sign in process.   
Thus, a admin have eidt buttons for any posts, a user can see edit buttons on the post only the user have made, a guest can't see any edit button in the website. The different veiws are controlled by React rendering according to the session info which is determined by log in.
